I remember a few things about my first software testing conference, now over 10 years ago, including being overwhelmed with new information. Yet I didn’t realize the outsized impact the conference had on me until I requested to go to another conference the following year. My boss was describing a conversation he had with our CEO and it went something like: “We sent Chris to that first conference and he came back a different person”. 

My boss saw that conference as a turning point in my career. I came back with a new approach to software testing that better fit our company. I was more engaged with my work and driven to do a better job. It also accelerated my learning journey. If that wasn’t enough, I also met people at that first conference that I'm friends with today. 

Education and connection are the two biggest reasons to attend a software testing event like a conference. In this post I’ll share 12 software testing events you can attend in 2021 that will hopefully have a similar impact on your career and life as it did for mine:

## [Swiss Testing Days 2021](https://swisstestingday.ch/?utm_source=testingconferences)

Swiss Testing Days is a non-profit, one day conference held in Zurich, Switzerland. Their goal is to bring together a local and international community of practitioners who can share experiences and ideas. I’ve heard great things about their community and engagement; if I was in Switzerland or was planning to be, I’d definitely go. 

For 2021, you'll find talks and workshops on a number of fascinating topics such as "Testing AI Bias and Organizational Values" and "Testing in the Age of Robotics". Perhaps most enticing is the closing Keynote called "Breaking down barriers" by David Aguilar on how he built a prosthetic arm out of LEGO bricks! 

**Date**: September 14, 2021 

## [Appium Conference 2021](https://appiumconf.com/?utm_source=testingconferences)

Appium Conference is THE event to go to if you use Appium or you test mobile devices. (Appium is the open source, mobile equivalent of Selenium). Just about anything you want to know about Appium or mobile device testing you'll be able to find here. From workshops run by Appiums's developers to talks by other mobile and automation experts, you'll find two days of jam packed online talks. 

Appium Conferences tutorials are hard to beat. They run the gamut from an introduction to Appium all the way to building your own drivers and plugins. It's hard to go wrong when the tutorials are by core committers of the project! 

**Date**: September 17-18, 2021


## [EuroSTAR 2021 Software Testing Conference](https://conference.eurostarsoftwaretesting.com/?utm_source=testingconferences)

EuroSTAR is Europe's largest software testing conference and has been running for nearly 30 years. This year they will have nearly 70 talks, keynotes and workshops which means you can find everything here. 

Topics include Systems Theory, Teaching testing through gamification, Whole Team approaches to Software Quality, Testing the Test Tools, Exploring the intersection of AI for Testing, Test Leadership and so much more. Not to mention EuroSTAR awards individuals for Best Paper, Best Tutorial, Testing Excellence (peer nominated) and more. There are few conferences that offer this much breadth and depth. Did I mention it is online?  

**Date**: September 28-30, 2021


## [STARWEST 2021](https://starwest.techwell.com/?utm_source=testingconferences)

One of (if not) the largest annual software testing and quality conferences in the United States, you can find everything here: training, workshops, keynote presentations, talks, leadership events and women who test networking events. With at least 3 talks going on simultaneously there is never a dull moment. Participants have a wide range of experience from beginners to 20 year veterans so networking with someone who has your interest or level of experience is almost guaranteed.

One of the most unique aspects of STARWEST is their "Lightning Strikes the Keynotes" where speakers get 5 minutes to deliver their single biggest idea in a rapid-fire presentation. This conference will be both online and in-person. 

**Date**: October 3-8, 2021

## [PNSQC 2021](https://www.pnsqc.org/2021-conference?utm_source=testingconferences)

Since 1982, the Pacific NorthWest Quality Conference (or PNSQC for short) has provided a technical conference beloved by practitioners and industry professionals alike. Smaller and more intimate than the larger conferences, PNSQC focuses on its community by delivering higher quality software through knowledge exchange. 

PNSQC's topics range from QA Engineering, People and Management, Technology and Tools to Poster Papers and Panels. PNSQC 2021 has one of the most solid lineups of new and interesting talks of any conference I've seen. In fact I have never seen (or heard) anything quite like the Poster Papers topic but I'm keen to learn more.

**Date**: October 11-13, 2021

## [HUSTEF 2021](https://hustef.hu/?utm_source=testingconferences)

The Hungarian Software Testing Forum has hosted a number of amazing speakers from all over the world. This year their Keynote speaker lineup is second to none. Featuring topics such as "How Testers Add Value to the Organization. But also, to ourselves" and "Hands off Exploratory Testing – How to Manage Test at Scale" and even talks on ROI and the Economics of Testing have me excited to learn more. If I was in Hungry or was planning to be, I’d definitely go. 


**Date**: October 18-21, 2021

## [TestFlix 2021 Global Software Testing Binge](https://www.thetesttribe.com/testflix-2021/?utm_source=testingconference)

TestFlix is a rather new online conference with a very unique concept: each "atomic" talk is about 8 minutes long, pre-recorded and there are roughly 100 of them. Talks are released over the two days of the conference in groups around "themes". 

Eventually all of the recordings are made available free to stream for anyone who wants to learn a little bit about a lot of topics. The challenge is picking which of the 100 talks to start with!

**Date**: October 23-24, 2021

## [OnlineTestConf Fall 2021](https://www.onlinetestconf.com/?utm_source=testingconference)

The OnlineTestConf is quite literally the original online testing conference. Accessible to anyone who signs up, the talks are attended live so you can ask questions of the speakers both in designated slack channels and within the talks themselves. The conference spans several days and all regions of the world. 

Recordings are made available at a later date for repeat viewing. This conference is free to attend and brings great value to the community. Run by the same people who run the annual State of Testing Survey, this conference always has a few topics that stretch your understanding of testing and quality. 

**Date**: November 3-4, 2021


## [CAST 2021](https://associationforsoftwaretesting.org/conference/cast-2021)

CAST, the Conference for the Association for Software Testing, has one of the most unique formats of any conference. All talks are facilitated to ensure speakers stay within their time limits. More importantly this allows for plenty of time for Open Season. Open Season is an orderly question and answer period at the end of the talk where attendees can question, dissect and discuss topics with the speaker and other attendees, similar to how you might discuss a peer conference. You might learn just as much from the discussion as you do from the talk. 

CAST is one of the few conferences to be held in person this year. Taking place in Atlanta, GA at the Atlanta Braves Stadium (after baseball season of course), one ticket will guarantee you both a tutorial spot and access to the full conference. The tutorial is being led by seasoned teacher Tariq King on Testing AI and Machine Learning. The talks are still being rolled out but include topics on Ethical Hacking for Testers, Building a Better Tomorrow with Model-Based Testing and How Testers Can Revolutionize AI and Machine Learning.

**Date**: November 8-9, 2021 

## [Testing United 2021](https://www.testingunited.com?utm_source=testingconferences)

Have you ever attended a conference in virtual reality? I haven't but I have to say the idea is quite tempting and Testing United offers that opportunity. Aside from the new approach to content delivery, their Keynote features two popular speakers in James Whittaker and Dona Sarkar. Other interesting talks include "A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up" by Tomasz Dubikowski and “Learning, Experimentation, and Feedback after COVID-19” by Jurgen Appelo.

Testing United is happening both in VR and on-site in Prague, Czech Republic.

**Date**: November 11-12, 2021


## [Agile Testing Days (ATD) 2021](https://agiletestingdays.com/?utm_source=testingconferences)

Agile Testing Days is a "festival" for the agile testing community. Festival is the right word with a mix of fun social activities, dress up events and deep insights in testing and agile excellence. This event features a number of talks around API Testing, Modern Test Management, Security Testing, Mental Health, Machine Learning and of course Agile Transformation (among other topics).

ATD, as it’s called, is on my wish list of conferences and with 4 days of social activities, workshops, tutorials, keynotes and talks I’d be there if I was going to be in Germany. I see a lot of interesting talks such as "Coming to terms with intelligence in machines" and "Interview with a system" to name a few.  

**Date**: November 15-18, 2021

## [System Testing and Validation (STV) 2021 Workshop at IEEE QRS conference](https://www.fokus.fraunhofer.de/en/sqc/event/stv21?utm_source=testingconferences)

Did you know there are more IEEE workshops and conferences taking place around the world than there are commercial or non-profit conferences? It's true! However they don't get the same love and attention among practitioners thanks to their focus on the more academic side of things. However if I was going to attend an IEEE workshop or conference this year it would be this one. 

System testing and validation is an area which has been the focus of research efforts for decades. Yet, due to  challenges resulting from new development processes, the need for efficient testing has been seeing much recent research. This workshop hopes to discuss these problems. 

**Date**: December 6-10, 2021

Attending conferences is one of the best ways to learn about the latest things happening in software testing. It’s even better when you are able to compare notes with your peers and exchange personal experiences. In the end you’ll walk away from the event with a handful of new ideas to try out when you get back to work (and maybe even a few friends). 

I’ve laid out 12 software testing events you can attend in 2021 that will hopefully have a positive impact on your life and career.
